# kubectl-pod-print-envs

`kubectl-pod-print-envs` is a `kubectl` plugin that allows you to interactively select a namespace and pod using fuzzy search (FZF-style), and then exec into the selected pod using `/bin/sh`.

This tool helps simplify navigating clusters with many namespaces and pods, especially when names are long or complex.
